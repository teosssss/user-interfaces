B)
Norman 7 stages are: 

forming the goal: in which I define a goal to reach, 

forming the intention: I form the intention to reach the goal, 

find the sequence action: I find the sequence of action to do in order to reach the goal, 

executing the action: I execute the action for reaching the goal, 

perceiving the state of the world: watch the page outcomes to my actions,

interpreting the state of the world and evaluating the outcome: I try to understand the outcomes of the page and I evaluate if my actions were right in order to reach my goal or not.
       
C) 
Goal: finding a film to watch

Forming the intentions: trying to find a film searching on the top film on the week in Netflix	

Find the sequence of action: go in Netflix, search for the film section, scroll to the top films and find	  
 the film

Execute the action: search Netflix in google, click on the the film section and click on the film when founded

Perceiving the state of the world:look if Netflix loaded correctly, see if I’m in the film section and in this case if the film is started correctly.

Interpreting the state of the world and evaluating the outcome: if I'm in Netflix and if I’m in the film section and the film is started my task is terminated correctly if not something went wrong with the film section page or with the start or the film.


D)
I think Netflix model of interaction is good defined, so it is really easy for a new user to find a film and watch it.
